This is the very first version of this app. As such, it is quite lean.
Feel free to add to it, take away from it, spit on it, or ignore it.
Just don't package it up for sale on the app store. That's my job. :)

To install this app:

1. just place it in the following directory: /_System/apps/
2. Go to your admin and click on the app called Profile
3. Authorize the app. The app must be authorized by the partner admin on the site.
4. Go to the help page and follow instructions in the Developer Setup area.
